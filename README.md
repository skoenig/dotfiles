  soekoe's dotfiles for feeling at home everywhere
</p>

This dotfiles repo contains configurations and customizations for bash, awesome, vim, git and some other tools I use frequently for my very own needs. YMMV.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/skoenig/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `~/.dotfiles` to your home directory.
